# Scripting Tutorial: Ksh (Korn Shell)
Â© Joaquin Menchaca, 2014

## Overview

OVERVIEW

## Gettting Korn Shell on Mac OS X

Mac OS X 10.8.5 comes with Ksh '93 93u (2011-02-08).

## Getting Korn Shell on Windows

Korn shell is available directly from AT&T Research Labs: http://www2.research.att.com/sw/download/.

The site is really confusing to navigate, and I could not recall how I ventually found binary installers.  I eventually found two, which install ksh 93u+:

* uwin-base.2012-08-06.win32.i386.exe
* uwin-base.2012-08-06.win32.i386-64.exe

After installation, ```ksh.exe``` will be installed into ```C:\Program FilesUWIN\usr\bin\``` alone with other tools.
