# Scripting Tutorial: AWK

Â© Joaquin Menchaca, 2014

## Overview

The AWK tool was introduced in Version 7 Unix and named after the authors: Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan.  AWK provided computational features to the Unix pipeline, and at the time, AWK was the only other scripting language available besides Bourne Shell.  

AWK was extremely popular in the 1970s and 1980s.  The available shell at the time (Bourne shell) was extremely limited, and AWK provided numerous capabilities absent from Bourne Shell.  This included rich text processing capabilities, math functions, and the capability to create arrays and associative arrays (hashes).

AWK was updated in the late 1980s with the release of nawk (New AWK) and gawk (GNU AWK).  In the 1990s, the popularity of Perl caused AWK to be used less for text-processing chores.

## Getting AWK

Today, AWK is apart of the GNU Core-Utilities [http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/] found on many Linux systems.  For UNIX systems or systems claiming to have POSIX compatibility, would likely have awk as apart of that tool set for compliance toward IEEE Std 1003.1, 2013 Edition [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/contents.html].

Thus, with any UNIX or Linux system, you can expect awk to be available.  For Windows, that is another matter.  You can get awk from a number of locations.  Here are a few:

- UWIN: Toolset from AT&T that contains tool chain typically found with SVR4 UNIX.
  - http://www2.research.att.com/sw/download/
- GitBash (msysgit): Tools built with Mingw, integrate with Windows and can be used along side Windows tools.  However, the version of awk included is a very old version of gawk.
- Cygwin: Enviroment on top of Windows that provides GNU tools.

## How It Works

AWK is quite different in that an AWK script works as a filter.  This means AWK scripts or oriented to receive text from the console, standard-input.  Thus AWK scripts are generally not interactive scripts, where you selectively read lines of input.  Thus most awk scripts will be run with input being sent directly into the script. Examples:

```
some_command | awkscript
awkscript < somefile.txt
```

AWK scripts have the ability to do pre-processing and post-processing before and after receiving input through the ```BEGIN``` and ```END``` blocks.  These tutorial scripts here will use the ```BEGIN``` blocks.  These tutorial scripts illustrate that AWK in and of itself is a powerful scripting language, and have the capabilities shared by other modern scripting languages.

## Issues

Environments will have AWK in either ```/bin/awk``` or ```/usr/bin/awk``` or both.  These scripts expect AWK to be in ```/bin/awk```.  The workaround, provided you have administration priviledges is to add a symbolic link.

On Mac OS X 10.8.5, you can do this:
```
sudo ln -s `which awk` /bin/awk
```

## Testing

* Windows 7 (32-bit), Gawk 3.0.4 (msysgit 1.9.2-preview20140411)
  * Issues:
    * ```length()``` only works on string, will not work on array
* Windows 7 (32-bit), Nawk (UWIN 2012-08-06)
  * Issues:
    * ```length()``` only works on string, will not work on array
* Mac OS X 10.8.5, Awk 20070501
  * Issues:
    * awk not in ```/bin/awk```, but found in ```/usr/bin/awk```

## Topics with Details 

This covers notes regarding each section.

1. **Output**
2. **Variables**
   * output variables using string concatenation with ```print```
   * output variables using string interpolation with ```printf```
3. **Arithmetic**
4. **Input**
5. **Branch**
   * select on number using ```if```
   * select on character using ```switch```
     * **NOTE** *This is not supported by POSIX awk or earlier versions of gawk.  This functionality is available in Gawk 3.1.5 and above*
   * select on character using ```if```
6. **Looping**
   * iterative (count) loop
   * conditional loop
   * collection loop
     * **OMITTED** *Awk does not have a true collection loop, so a conditional loop that pulls from standard-input was used as an alternative*
7. **Arrays**
   * populate array using index
   * populate array using list of items
     * **NOTES** Awk does not have syntax support to declare an array on one line.  However, a ```split(string, array)``` function with a space delimited string will work. 
     * enumerate array using collection loop
       * **NOTES** 
          * Awk does not have a collection loop, but rather pulls an key from the array
          * Awk does not have real arrays, as indexes are actually strings.  The for loop, i.e.  ```for (key in array)```, can pull indexes (keys) in any order.
     * enumerate array using iterative loop
       * **NOTES** 
         * Awk does not have support to get the ```length``` of an array. Such functionality was added with GNU Awk (gawk) 3.1.5 and after.
         * A helper function of ```array_length()``` was created to support this.
8. **Associative Arrays**
   * Create Associative Array using key value
   * Create Associative Array using supplied list
     * **OMITTED** This gets complicated to even demonstrate, especially as Awk has no native syntax for this, and does not support returning arrays from functions.
9. **Subroutines** 
   * utilize subroutine that prints the current date in "Month Day, Year" format
10. *Arguments*
    * demonstrate testing for two arguments
    * print list of all arguments with count
    * print list of all arguments in reverse with count
11. *Parameters*
   * demonstrate passing 1 parameter
     * utilize subroutine that prints celsius temperature when supplied fahrenheit temperature
   * demonstrate passing unlimited parameters
     * **Note** *AWK does not support variable parameters, so an array is passed instead.*
     * utilize subroutine prints sum of all numbers passed into it.
12. **Functions**
    * demonstrate returning integer
      * returns summation of all numbers passed into function 
    * demonstrate returning string
      * returns capitalized string from lower case string
