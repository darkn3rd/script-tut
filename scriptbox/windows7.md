## Windows 7 (Windows NT 6.1)
Â©2014 Joaquin Menchaca

Some of these command may require running either PowerShell console or Command Shell (cmd.exe) in privileged mode: right click on `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` and select `Run as administrator`.

### Environments and Packages

Windows has at least four environments to get shell and shell utilities:

* [Cygnus Windows (CygWin)](https://www.cygwin.com/) - a simulated Unix environment and can call DOS commands in addition to tools built under CygWin.  Combined with package installer cyg-apt, you can install any missing components.
* [MSYS-Git](https://msysgit.github.io/) (GitBash) - Git, Bash, and a minimal set of GNU tools ported to Windows using MinGW.
* [UWIN](http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/download/uwin/uwin.html) - Korn shell and official AT&T Unix Korn utilities, along with some open source utilities bundled up into this environment.
* [GNUWin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/) - GNU utilities ported directly to Windows and can run under Windows command shell (`cmd.exe`)

Outside of these shell environments, packages can be downloaded individually, or installed through a package management like [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/).


### Scripting Languages (All Environments)

These are individual packages that can be installed independently of any environment.

#### AWK

[GnuWin32 Gawk](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gawk.htm) will work in all environments:

* http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gawk.htm

As an alternative to installing these types of tools in the default location of `C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32`, you can do a silent background install using this, in a privileged command prompt:

```Batch
C:\> cd %USERPROFILE%\Downloads
C:\Users\riker\Downloads> gawk-3.1.6-1-setup.exe /dir=C:\GnuWin32 /verysilent
C:\Users\riker\Downloads> setx /M PATH "%PATH%;C:\GnuWin32"
```

#### Groovy

Groovy can be installed from the source:

* http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download

Groovy can also be installed with [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
C:\> choco install groovy
```

Note that Groovy requires that Java SE Runtime Environment is available.  This can be downloaded from Sun:

* Oracle Java SE Homepage: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html

#### Perl

There are two popular packages for installing Perl on Windows:

* **ActivePerl** - http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads
* **Starberry Perl** - http://strawberryperl.com/

ActivePerl can be installed through [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
C:\> choco install activeperl
```

StrawberryPerl can be installed through [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
C:\> choco install strawberryperl
```

#### PHP

PHP can be unzipped and manually copied to a location to a desired location:

* PHP on Windows - http://windows.php.net/

PHP can be installed through [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
C:\> choco install php
```

#### Python

Python is available from the the Python website or as ActivePython:

* Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
* ActivePython - http://www.activestate.com/activepython

The Python from the source can be through [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
C:\> choco install python2
```

#### Ruby

Ruby can be installed through Ruby Installer or PIK.  

* Ruby Installer - http://rubyinstaller.org/
* PIK - https://github.com/vertiginous/pik

These can be installed through [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
choco install ruby
choco install pik
```

#### TCL (Tool Command Language) or *Tickle*

ActiveTCL is available from ActiveState:

* ActiveTCL - http://www.activestate.com/activetcl

This can alternatively be installed using [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
C:\> choco install activetcl
```

### MSYS-Git Environment

#### Shells

For the missing shell tools, you'll need to download them and make sure that they are in the path:

* :package: bc (download from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bc.htm)
* :package: seq (download from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm) `choco install gnuwin`

### CygWin Environment

Download and install the appropriate CygWin environment.  These instructions are for 64-bit version: `setup-x86_64.exe`.  Run through the setup and select the defaults. Assuming that the setup program was installed in your Downloads folder, run CygWin64 Terminal from Start menu and then run these commands to get `apt-cyg` wrapper:

```bash
$ cd $USERPROFILE/Downloads
$ ./setup-x86_64.exe -q -P wget
$ wget http://apt-cyg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/apt-cyg
$ chmod +x apt-cyg
