# Scripting Tutorial: Bash (Bourne Again Shell)

Â© Joaquin Menchaca, 2014

## Overview

*Bourne Again Shell* (bash) written by Brian Fox and releated in 1989 as a dropp in replacement for the original shell *Bourne Shell* (sh).  Bash extends the shell with new features, mixing in ideas borrowed from C Shell (csh) and Korn Shell (ksh).

Bash is compatible as a POSIX shell and will run in strict POSIX mode when accessed as ```sh```.  There may have been non-portable features that still work in this mode; such features are called bashisms.

Bash 4 adds a number of features, such as associative arrays and new parameter expansions to do uppercase and lowercase on variables.

## Getting Bash on Mac OS X

Mac OS X 10.8.5 comes with GNU Bash 3.2.48.

### Homebrew

Homebrew [http://brew.sh/] is a popular single-user package management system that can install a variety of scripting languages and tools, which includes Bash 4.

Homebrew and Bash 4 can be installed with these commands (Tested on Mac OS X 10.8.5):

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
brew update
brew doctor
echo export PATH='/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo export BASH_VERSION=$(/usr/local/bin/bash -version | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f4)
. ~/.bash_profile
brew install bash
```

## Getting Bash on Windows

### GitBash (MSYS)

An easy way to get Bash on Windows is to use Git Bash from msysgit from http://msysgit.github.io/.  This installs a set of Mingw GNU tools.  Currently, Mingw has an earlier version of GNU bash 3.1.0.

When running Git Bash on Windows, you might notice that some paths in the ```$PATH``` still have Windows path names.  This happens when the Windows ```%PATH%``` includes other variables, such as ```%JAVA_HOME%```.  

To fix this, you can source this script to fix that situation if this occurs:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# convert DOS style %varibles% to UNIX style ${variables}
NEWPATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed 's/%\([^%]*\)%/${\1}/g')
 
# resolve all variables in $PATH
eval NEWPATH=\"${NEWPATH}\"
 
# convert DOS paths (C:\path\) to UNIX paths (/c/path/)
PATH="$(echo "${NEWPATH}" | sed \
   -e 's@^\([a-zA-Z]\):\\@/\L\1/@g' \
   -e 's@:\([a-zA-Z]\):\\@:/\L\1/@g' \
   -e 's@\\@/@g')"
 
export PATH
```

## Testing

* Mac OS X 10.8.5

```bash
$ /bin/bash -version | head -1
