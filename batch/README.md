# Scripting Tutorial: BATCH (Command Shell)

Â© Joaquin Menchaca, 2014

## Overview

This covers the Windows Command Shell, sometimes referred to as BATCH due to its history.  


## History 

The *BATCH* environment has existed since 1981 with the releases of MS-DOS, IBM PC-DOS, and DR-DOS (Digital Research). Different versions of Windows 4.x (a.k.a. Windows '95 to Windows ME) were bundled with MS-DOS, and thus by nature included the the BATCH environment.

A new environment, called *Command Shell*, was introduced with the with OS/2 from IBM, and later with Microsoft Windows NT.  Future versions of Windows NT, marketed as Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, and so forth, continue to carry the *Command Shell*.

## Usage

The original BATCH environment was extremely limited, and was extended in a variety of ways.  In MS-DOS, many were able to compile small Assembly language scripts using ```DEBUG```, and with MS-DOS 5.0, Basic scripts using  ```QBASIC /RUN```, and in PC-DOS, there was the REXX scripting environment.  REXX was popular on mainframes and Amiga OS.  An alternative third party called 4DOS was quite popular, as well as MKS Tools, which provided Korn Shell capability to DOS. The toolset DGJPP (http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/) provided UNIX tools to DOS.  

Today, Command Shell has added features beyond its earlier BATCH cousin, but it is still quite limited.  For any heavy lifting, Microsoft has provided WSH (Windows Scripting Host) with support for languages like VBScript and JScript (JavaScript) for scripting the environment.  Also popular were languages like Perl, Python, Ruby, and KiXart (http://www.kixtart.org/).  Today, especially after Windows 2008, PowerShell has become the one ubiquitous language for modern Windows operating systems, but still the Command Shell remains popular for basic chores.

## Notes 

This covers notes regarding each section.

1. Output
   * demonstrate escaping characters with carrot ```^``` character
2. Variables
3. Arithmetic
4. Input
5. Branch
   * IF on number
   * case statements **OMITTED** *Does not exist in Command Shell.*
   * IF on single character
     * Uses external command ```FINDSTR``` to match string pattern.  Note that regular expressions in ```FINDSTR``` cannot distinguish between uppercase and lowercase characters, so ```[a-z]``` is the same as ```[A-Z]```.
6. Looping
   * iterative loop 
      * example: 10 to 1
   * conditional loops
      * *Note:* Simulated with ```GOTO``` statements 
   * collection loop
      * iterate through set of items generated by subshell
      * example: directory listing
7. Arrays
   * **OMITTED** *Does not exist in Command Shell.*
8. Associative Arrays
   * **OMMITTED** *Does not existin Command Shell.*
9. Subroutine
   * **NOTE** *Utilizes ```CALL``` and ```GOTO``` for this type of functionality.*
10. Arguments
    * Print all arguments
      * *Note:* Simulated with ```GOTO``` statements as ```SHIFT``` doesn't work in ```FOR``` loops
11. Parameters
    * **OMITTED** *Does not exist in Command Shell.*
12. Function
    * **OMITTED** *Does not exist in Command Shell.*
