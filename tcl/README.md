## Overview

TCL or Tool Command Language, pronounced as *tickle*, was created by John Ousterhout in 1988.  The language was initially used for embedded systems automation, such as testing small independent tools.  

TCL (*tickle*) achieved enormous popularity in the 1990s with the release of the Tk GUI toolkit in 1991.  At the time the common toolsets for creating graphics required were complex and were not portable to different systems (as it was compiled to one system).  Around this time, the programs had to use libraries that used [X Window System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System), [Mac OS Toolbox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Toolbox) ([QuickDraw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw)), and [Windows API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API) (Win16 API).  

With the Tk GUI toolkit, a novice programmer could create graphical programs in minutes and share it on numerous systems that supported Tcl/Tk. This included systems like many UNIX systems, [Windows 3.1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x), [Mac OS System 7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_7), [Amiga OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmigaOS), [OS/2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2), [OpenVMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) and others.

Another popular tool called [Expect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect), created by Don Libes, that used TCL as its embedded language, gained popularity.  This tool allowed automating interactive command-line programs.

Apple even utilized TCL as the language for a test-harness called Curare, which tested modules that tested the network stack and imaging products. Apple also used TCL for scripting automation of microkernel modules in [NuKernel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nukernel) before they embarked on path to buy either [BeOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS) or [NeXTSTEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP) around 1996.

Gradually, popularity of TCL dwindled, perhaps due to increasing popularity of the [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28software_platform%29) platform, and rising popularity of web-client applications.  These technologies allowed sharing graphically applications that could run anywhere that [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28software_platform%29) or a web browser existed.  There were some tools created to integrate with these new technologies, such as [TclBlend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl/Java), [Jacl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl/Java) (TCL code that compiles to Java Bytecode), [TCL Plugin](http://www.tcl.tk/software/plugin/) (Netscape plug-in that allows running TCL in web pages).

Today, you can see TCL is used in niche solutions, such as [Cisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems) networking equipement and [F5 BigIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F5_Networks#BIG-IP) load balancers.

## Discoveries

These are some strange things I noticed when scripting in TCL:

* ***String Concatenation*** - this seems not existent. There are some functions that exist, but these pad spaces  before and after each string part, so it is better to use *string interpolation*.
* ***Arrays*** - indexed arrays do not exist, instead they seem to be space delimited strings, with some tooling to get some array-like functionality. For this reason, associative arrays are (called *arrays* in TCL) are often used as an alternative.
* ***Accosciative Arrays*** - these are just called *arrays* in TCL.  TCL can extract the keys from an associative array, but has no mechanism to extract the values.
* ***Variable Parameters*** - when creating a sub-routine or function (called *procedures* in TCL) that accepts unknown number of arguments, you must explicitly call this `args`.

## Testing

* :dvd: *__OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion)__*
  * :cd: tclsh 8.5 (bundled with operating system)

## Topics

Here are the tutorial snippets for TCL, broken into two sections.

### Part I: Basic Structures, Logic, Input and Output

This section includes the basic mechanics of a language: input/output, branching and looping, and basic variables, arrays, and associative arrays.
