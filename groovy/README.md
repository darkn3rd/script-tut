# Scripting Tutorial: Groovy

Version 1.4

Â© Joaquin Menchaca, 2014

## Overview

Groovy is a scripting language that runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).  As such it has access to the robust library available on the Java Platform.

The langauge adopts a lot of syntax sugar found in popular languages of Ruby, Python, and Perl. With these features and dynamic types, it dramatically decreases the verbosity required in Java language.  Perhaps for this reason, Groovy has become quite popoular.

I personally came across Groovy as a scripting language that is popular for build automation for use with continious integration environments such as Jenkins.

A number of popular tools are developed using Groovy, such as:

* **Gaiden** [https://github.com/kobo/gaiden] - toolkit for creating documentation in MarkDown
* **Gaelyk** [http://gaelyk.appspot.com/] - toolkit for Google App Engine.
* **Gradle** [http://www.gradle.org/] - task oriented build tool similiar Rake.
* **Grafitti** [https://github.com/webdevwilson/graffiti] - a web microframework inspirted by Sinatra.
* **Grails** [https://grails.org/] - robust web MVC framework
* **Griffon** [http://griffon.codehaus.org/] - MVC framework for desktop applications
* **Groovy enVironment Manager** [http://gvmtool.net/] - tools to manage versions of Groovy and popolar Groovy tools and frameworks.

## History

Groovy was developed by James Strachan and officially released in 2007.  Strachan silently left the project a year before its release.  Groovy 2.0 was released in 2012.

## Getting Groovy

Groovy requires Java Development Kit, and so this must be installed for Groovy to run.

Groovy 2.3 adds support for Java NIO (Non-Blocking I/O), which requires JDK7.  This will need to be installed to avoid constant warnings that NIO is not available when working with Groovy 2.3.

### Getting Python on Mac

As for prerequisites on the Mac, you'll need to install XCode, XCode command line tools, and the most recent JDK.

Apple provides an updated version of JDK6 (Java 1.6) for Mac OS X 10.8 Mountian Lion.  Optionally, a more recent JDK, such as the one from Java 1.7 or Java 1.8 can be installed from Oracle.

#### Homebrew

Homebrew [http://brew.sh/] is a popular single-user package management system that can install a variety of scripting languages and tools, which includes Groovy.

This version of Groovy may not be the latest.  Consider alternatively getting GVM (Groovy enVironment Manager) to get the latest Groovy and manage or test different versions of Groovy.

Homebrew and Groovy can be installed with these commands (Tested on Mac OS X 10.8.5):

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
brew update
brew doctor
echo export PATH='/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
. ~/.bash_profile
brew install groovy
```

#### Groovy enVironment Manager

GVM [http://gvmtool.net/] is tool that can manager versions of Groovy and related tools and frameworks.  

Some of the popular tools and frameworks supportd by GVM include Gaiden [https://github.com/kobo/gaiden], GRails [https://grails.org/], Griffon [http://griffon.codehaus.org/], Gradle [http://www.gradle.org/]

GVM can be installed on Mac OS X using: 

```bash
curl -s get.gvmtool.net | bash
```

Afterwards, you can install groovy:

```bash
gvm install groovy
```

## Testing

* Mac OS X 10.8.5 Mountain Lion

```bash
$ java -version
java version "1.7.0_60"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_60-b19)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.60-b09, mixed mode)
$ groovy -version
Groovy Version: 2.3.3 JVM: 1.7.0_60 Vendor: Oracle Corporation OS: Mac OS X
$ gvm version
Groovy enVironment Manager 1.3.13
```
