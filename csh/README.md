# Scripting Tutorial: C Shell

## Overview

Welcome to C Shell tutorial.  This will teach the basics on how to get around in C Shell scripting.

## Getting C Shell on Mac OS X

Mac OS X 10.8.5 comes with TCsh 6.17.00 (Astron) built on 2009-07-10.

## History

C Shell was created by Bill Joy in the 1970s and was distributed with BSD UNIX and went on to become the default shell for BSD UNIX flavors.  C Shell became popular both for its C language-like syntax, and rich and easy to use customization.  

C Shell is widely known to have problems and limitations, and does not have basic features like functions.  So many may have opted out from using C Shell for any professional scripting, but still used the shell environment to interface with UNIX and Linux systems.  Today, C Shell has not fixed many of its issues (which probably requires a rewrite)
and it is unable to keep up with robust feature set afforded in other shells.

## Language Quirks

The language itself has posed some quirks that are not some randomly discovered bug, but are the actual behavior.  Two that I found quite profound.  Any reserved word that terminates a block, absolutely must be followed by a newline.  If it is not, weird stuff happens.  Spaces followed by one of these block terminators, such as ```endif``` or ```end```, will also cause the block to fail.  Also, found out that when processing input, ```set variable=$<```, only the first word is captured, and a quoted string with spaces causes ```set: Syntax Error.```.

Beyond these quirks, the language is extremely limited.  Here are a few of the limitations I have found:

  * cannot store any type of float, even as a string.  Thus "3.14" can never be saved into any variable, even if used as a string.
  * NO functions or subroutines (clever hacks with alias and goto is a workaround)
  * arrays items cannot be inserted by index, they must be concatenated into an existing array.
  * arrays items can be retrieved by an index.

Lastly, besides BATCH programming, this language has the ***LEAST*** capabilities of any scripting language.  There are reasons many a system administrator are saying "*don't use it*". Unless job security is needed, such as C Shell that spawns Awk scripts that sub-shell perl one-liners that may call C Shell again, I don't see the utility... :)

And anyone documenting C Shell, it seems it is traditional to reference this document:

## Why Document C-Shell At All?

I know someone one is thinking of this...

I wanted to document this for these reasons that come to mind: (1) nostalgia, (2) hardly any documentation out there, (3) comparison, and (4) completeness.  In pre-Linux days, BSD Unix was quite popular and thus the C-Shell that came with it was quite popular.  

When I started out, I used to use C-Shell on [68K](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000_series) [Macintoshes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh) with either   [MachTen](http://www.tenon.com/products/machten/) or [NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org/), and on [PC clones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible), I used it on [NeXTSTEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP) 3.3.

## Notes

These are things I discovered in developing C-Shell material.

* C-Shell simulates *array* functionality using space-delimited strings, which can be processed using a collection loop or through an index.
* C-Shell definatley does not suport *associative arrays*.
* C-Shell does not support *subroutines* or *functions*.  There might be some clever hacks with `alias` or `goto :label` to get some of this functionality.
