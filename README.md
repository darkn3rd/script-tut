# Scripting Tutorial

Â© Joaquin Menchaca, 2014

## Overview
This is a general tutorial of scripting modeled after typical tasks one would do with shell programming.  Thus it is oriented toward common tasks in system administration.  As this is a tutorial that demonstrates basic features of a given language, it doubles as a handy reference.

## Languages

The current languages are supported:
  - Awk
  - BATCH (Windows)
  - Bourne Shell (POSIX)
  - Bourne Again Shell
  - Korn Shell
  - Perl
  - PHP
  - PowerShell (Windows)
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - VBScript (Windows)

## Content 

Not all of the content can adequately be covered for every language.  The scripts attempt to cover the following topics:

1. Output
   * simple output to stdout
2. Variables
   * array declaration of number, characters, strings
3. Arithmetic
   * basic integer arithmetic
   * floating point arithmetic
   * math functions
4. Input
   * simple input from stdin
5. Branch
   * if on number
   * case on single character
   * if on single character
6. Looping
   * iterative loop 
      * example: 10 to 1
   * conditional loops
   * collection loop
      * iterate through set of items 
      * example: directoy listing
7. Arrays
   * Array Initialization
      * initialize array by index
      * array length
      * enumerate all elements
   * Array Enumeration 
      * declare and initialize array
      * enumerate array by collection loop
   * Array Enumeration
      * declare and initialize array
      * enumerate array by index
8. Associative Arrays
   * Associative Array Initialization
      * initialize associative array by key
      * enumerate all keys
      * enumerate all values
   * Assoication Array Enumeration
      * declate and initizliae associative array
      * merge two associative arrays
      * enumerate associative array by key
9. Parameters
10. Subroutines
11. Options
