# ConfigBox: Ansible

Â© Joaquin Menchaca, 2015

## Overview

This area demonstrates how Ansible can be used to configure a ScriptBox environment.  The ScriptBox is an environment that can run demonstration scripts found within this tutorial.

Currently this section in under experimentation.

## Push Technolgy

Ansible is different that other provisioning technologies in that it is a push technology, meaning that Ansible remotely logs into a system invokes commands.  This is different that the pull technologies (CFEngine 3, Chef, or Puppet) that use an agent to pull down a configuration and apply it locally on the system.  

Ansible has the ability to run a configuration loocally on a system, but Vagrant's Ansible provisioner does not support this.  The provisioner will run ansible on the host system (thus requires a python environment and ansible) and then remotely logs into the system to do the magic.

## Hostname Based Configuration

By default, Vagrant's Ansible provisioner logs into the system, and automatically crafts a one-system inventory file (stored as `.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory`).  

For small scripts and experiments, this automated behavior may be acceptable, but for a managed repository of code that supports many unique systems, such as database server with MySQL installed or a web server with Apache installed, this solution may not work.

The Vagrantfile configuration files found in here, simulate hostbased configuration, so if there's host called `db01` and a host called `web01`, with unique configurations, e.g. MySQL and Apache, for those systems based on their hostname.  This is done by managing a vagrant inventory file (`provisoning/vagrant.ini`) that is used by Ansible to provision these systems.
