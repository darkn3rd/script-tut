# ConfigBox

## Overview

This area will have details about how to configure a system with all the scripting languages needed for this tutorial.

## Vagrant

Currently developing some Vagrant scripts for CentOS 6, Ubuntu Precise, and Debian Wheezy.

I have had some success with Mac OS X and Windows systems, but holding off on these as they are more complicated and require special care for packages on those systems.

## Puppet Apply

Puppet Scripts have been tested with Wheezy (Debian 7), Precise (Ubuntu 12), and CentOS 6.

## Chef

Currently experimenting with Chef (Chef-Solo and Chef-Zero).  Currently have scripts that are working, but do not know how to yet configure on a node by node basis.
