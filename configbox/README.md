## Overview

This area will have details about how to configure a system with all the scripting languages needed for this tutorial.

## Vagrant

Currently developing some Vagrant scripts for:
  * ***Wheezy (Debian 7)***
  * ***Precise (Ubuntu 12)***
  * ***CentOS 6***

These scripts only support simple package installations for now

I have had some success with ***Mac OS X*** and ***Windows*** systems, but holding off on these as they are more complicated and require special care for packages on those systems.

I would like to support language specific version managers (gvm, rvm, rbenv) and groovy with Java depenency.


## Change Configuration Systems

These are the current systems I am working for this simple experiment.

### Ansible

This has to be the easiest one to get working (15 minutes).  All systems regardless of host name will get the same configuration, as node based configuration is implausible with only Vagrant's automation.

For details on why node based configuration is diffcult, this has to due with the nature of push-based change-config tools, which have to know IP addresses and unique SSH port in advance before pushing a configuration to the system.

On virtual systems hosted on the same system, all the servers will have 127.0.0.1 as their address, and some random port for SSH access.

### Chef

There are also numerous ways to configure a system with Chef as well.  I am focusing on these tools:

* **Chef-Solo**
  * Vagrant's `chef_solo` Provisioner
  * **Knife-Solo** as the provisioner

I was able to have node based configuration (using hostname) with Vagrant's Chef-Solo provisioner, and Knife-Solo tool.  Both remotely log into the system and run `chef solo`.

### Puppet

There are numerous ways to configure Puppet. I am focusing on these two areas:

* **Puppet with Node Definitions** - uses main site manifests (`manifests/site.pp`)
* **Puppet with Hiera** - an alternative system to store configurations and parameters using YAML (or another datasource like JSON or LDAP)

Both of these I have used using the Vagrant's puppet provisioner.
