## Overview

This area will have details about how to configure a system with all the scripting languages needed for this tutorial.

## Vagrant

Currently developing some Vagrant scripts that may be useful in running Windows, CentOS (RHEL), Ubuntu, CygWin, and Mac OS X environments.

## Puppet Apply

I am developing some Puppet modules to install these scripting environments.  Also sprinkling in some Vagrant scripts that auto-bootstrap the provisioning.

## Chef Solo

I will be developing similar Chef recipes to install these scripting environments. Also sprinkling in some Vagrant scripts that auto-bootstrap the provisioning.
