# ConfigBox: Ansible

Â© Joaquin Menchaca, 2015

## Overview

This area demonstrates how Ansible can be used to configure a ScriptBox environment.  The ScriptBox is an environment that can run demonstration scripts found within this tutorial.

Currently this section in under experimentation.

## Push Technolgy

Ansible is interesting in that it is a push technology, rather than a pull technology like Chef or Puppet.  Thus you need to know the systems in advance, before provisioning the systems.  As Vagrant systems are dynamically created, with a unique port for accessing ssh, this provides a bit of a challenge.
