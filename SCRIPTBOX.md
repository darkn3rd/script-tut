# Scripting Box

Â© Joaquin Menchaca, 2014

## Overview

This is my cumulative installation guide to getting scripting languages for your platform.

### Required Knowledge

You'll need to be confortable using the shell environment, whether on Windows or Linux/Unix environment.  You should be able to do typical tasks like:

 * interacting with shell environment
   * sourcing shell scripts (Unix/Linux)
   * configure shell environment: `.profile`, `.bashrc`
 * configuring environment variables
   * user and system environment (Windows)
   * exporting environment variables (Unix/Linux)
   * adjusting `PATH`
 * creating symbolic links
 * using `which` or `command` (Unix/Linux)
 * escalating privileges
   * `sudo`  (Unix/Linux)
   * `Run as Administrator` (Windows)

## Tested Operating Systems

These scripts should work on any Unix, Linux, or Windows systems provided the required tools, shells, application virtual machines, and scripting environments are available.  Unix is inclusive of SVR4 Unixes (Solaris), BSD Unixes (FreeBSD), and Mac OS X (which bundles BSD flavored tools and partial BSD flavored configuration environemnt).

These scripts have been specifically ad-hoc tested:
* :dvd: **Mac OS X 10.8.5 (*Snow Leopard*)** with XCode 5.1.1
* :dvd: **Cent OS 6.5**
* :dvd: **Windows 7 (*Windows NT 6.1*)**.  

Some limited testing has been done on
* :dvd: **Fedora 20 (*Heisenbug*)**
* :dvd: **Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (*Precise Pangolin*)**
* :dvd: **Mac OS X 10.9.5 (*Maverick*)** with XCode 6.1

## Required Packages

On any system, these are the needed tools:

* **Application Virtual Machine**: Java SE Runtime Environment (`java`)
* **Command Line Tools**: `awk`, `bc`, `command` `cut`, `data`, `env`, `expr`, `grep`, `printf`, `sed`, `seq`, `tr`, `which`, `wc`
* **Shell Environments**: `dash`, `bash`, `ksh`, `tcsh`
* **Scripting Languages**: `awk`, `groovy`, `perl`, `php`, `python`, `ruby`, `tclsh`

Most Linux and Unix systems will come bundled with most of these tools, or have package management or ports systems that allow for ease to download and install these tools and environments.  

For Mac OS X and Windows, there can be some challenges, so the guidelines below may help get the needed packages.

# Installation Notes

## Mac OS X 10.9.5 (Maverick)

Mac OS X 10.9.5 Maverick has some of the basic packages required.  These instructions install new packages or install alternatives to existing older components.  

* :package: Awk 20070501 (BSD)
* :package: Perl 5.16.2
* :package: PHP 5.4.24
* :package: Python 2.7.5
* :package: Ruby 2.0.0p247
* :package: Shells

  * :package: csh (tcsh) 6.17
  * :package: ksh 93u 2011-02-08
* :package: (tclsh) 8.5

### Prerequisites

#### XCode

Download the latest [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), XCode command line tools, and optionally [Java for OS X](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572)

#### Java JDK

Java JDK variety is required, as JRE only installs a plug-in.  Here's an example of installing JDK 1.8:

```bash
$ curl -v -j -k -L -H "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u25-b17/jdk-8u25-macosx-x64.dmg > ~/Downloads/jdk-8u25-macosx-x64.dmg
$ hdiutil mount ~/Downloads/jdk-8u25-macosx-x64.dmg
$ sudo -S installer -verbose -pkg "/Volumes/JDK 8 Update 25/JDK 8 Update 25.pkg" -target /
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_25"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_25-b17)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.25-b02, mixed mode)
```

#### HomeBrew

Install [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/) as the package manage:

```bash
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
$ brew update
$ brew doctor
```

### Installation of Packages

Instead of documenting every little piece, here's a list of instructions to install, configure, and verify the needed components:

### Tools

```bash
$ brew install gnu-sed --with-default-names

## Mac OS X 10.8.5 (Snow Leopard)

### Package Managers

Mac OS X 10.8.5 comes with basics shells (ksh, csh, bash) and Unix tools required for most of these tutorials.  For GNU versions of some of the tools, and for updated versions of shells or scripting environments, you can use package managers, such as:

* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) - installs packages for a single user only, supports third party repositories, has ability to use packages or build from source.
* [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) - intalls packages for all users, so ideal for servers; builds tools and libraries using ports directory tree.
* [Rudix](http://rudix.org/) - uses pre-built installable packages using Apple's `.pkg` standard

### XCode Requirement

Before getting package managers, you'll want to install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), XCode command line tools, and [Java for OS X](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572)

### Defaults (pre-baked)

Mac OS X 10.8.5 Snow Leopard comes with the following scripting tools:

* :package: Awk 20070501 (BSD)
* :package: Perl 5.12.4
* :package: PHP 5.3.28

## Windows 7 (Windows NT 6.1)

Some of these command may require running either PowerShell console or Command Shell (cmd.exe) in privileged mode: right click on `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` and select `Run as administrator`.

### Environments and Packages

Windows has at least four environments to get shell and shell utilities:

 * [Cygnus Windows (CygWin)](https://www.cygwin.com/) - a simulated Unix environment and can call DOS commands in addition to tools built under CygWin.  Combined with package installer cyg-apt, you can install any missing components.
 * [MSYS-Git](https://msysgit.github.io/) (GitBash) - Git, Bash, and a minimal set of GNU tools ported to Windows using MinGW.
 * [UWIN](http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/download/uwin/uwin.html) - Korn shell and official AT&T Unix Korn utilities, along with some open source utilities bundled up into this environment.
 * [GNUWin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/) - GNU utilities ported directly to Windows and can run under Windows command shell (`cmd.exe`)

Outside of these shell environments, packages can be downloaded individually, or installed through a package management like [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):


### Scripting Languages (All Environments)

These are individual packages that can be installed independently of any environment.

#### AWK

[GnuWin32 Gawk](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gawk.htm) will work in all environments:

 * http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gawk.htm

As an alternative to installing these types of tools in the default location of `C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32`, you can do a silent background install using this, in a privileged command prompt:

```Batch
C:\> cd %USERPROFILE%\Downloads
C:\Users\riker\Downloads> gawk-3.1.6-1-setup.exe /dir=C:\GnuWin32 /verysilent
C:\Users\riker\Downloads> setx /M PATH "%PATH%;C:\GnuWin32"
```

#### Groovy

Groovy can be installed from the source:

* http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download

Groovy can also be installed with [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
C:\> choco install groovy
```

Note that Groovy requires that Java SE Runtime Environment is available.  This can be downloaded from Sun:

* Oracle Java SE Homepage: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html

#### Perl

There are two popular packages for installing Perl on Windows:

 * **ActivePerl** - http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads
 * **Starberry Perl** - http://strawberryperl.com/

ActivePerl can be installed through [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
C:\> choco install activeperl
```

StrawberryPerl can be installed through [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
C:\> choco install strawberryperl
```

#### PHP

PHP can be unzipped and manually copied to a location to a desired location:

   * PHP on Windows - http://windows.php.net/

PHP can be installed through [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
C:\> choco install php
```

#### Python

Python is available from the the Python website or as ActivePython:

 * Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
 * ActivePython - http://www.activestate.com/activepython

The Python from the source can be through [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
C:\> choco install python2
```

#### Ruby

Ruby can be installed through Ruby Installer or PIK.  

 * Ruby Installer - http://rubyinstaller.org/
 * PIK - https://github.com/vertiginous/pik

These can be installed through [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
choco install ruby
choco install pik
```

#### TCL (Tool Command Language) or *Tickle*

ActiveTCL is available from ActiveState:

* ActiveTCL - http://www.activestate.com/activetcl

This can alternatively be installed using [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/):

```Batch
C:\> choco install activetcl
```

### MSYS-Git Environment
